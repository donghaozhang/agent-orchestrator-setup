# Git Add, Commit & Push

Review all changes, stage them, create a commit with a clear message, and push to the remote.

## Steps

1. Run `git status` to see all modified/untracked files and `git diff` to review changes. Also run `git log --oneline -5` for recent commit style.
2. Analyze the changes and draft a concise conventional commit message (`type: description`).
3. Stage the relevant files with `git add` (prefer specific files over `git add -A`).
4. Commit using the conventional commit format.
5. Push to the current remote branch with `git push`.
6. Report the commit hash and summary.

## Rules

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `chore:`
- Do not stage `.env` files or secrets
- If there are no changes, report "Nothing to commit" and stop
